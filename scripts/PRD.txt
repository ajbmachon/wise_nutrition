# Overview  
Wise Nutrition is a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot application that serves as an expert in nutrient theory, vitamins and minerals, and natural remedies based on Weston A. Price Foundation research. The application helps users improve their nutrition by providing evidence-based advice on addressing nutritional deficiencies through natural eating and traditional food preparation methods.

The chatbot leverages pre-processed structured data from authoritative sources on nutrition and traditional diets, enabling it to provide specific, actionable advice while maintaining factual accuracy. The application serves as an alternative to conventional nutrition information by focusing on traditional wisdom and natural approaches to nutrition.

# Core Features  
## Nutrition Knowledge Base
- What it does: Provides access to three specialized collections of nutrition knowledge (nutrient theory, vitamins/minerals, and natural remedies)
- Why it's important: Offers users evidence-based information that may not be commonly available in mainstream nutrition resources
- How it works: Utilizes vector embeddings of pre-processed nutrition data stored in a Chroma database, enabling semantic search and retrieval of relevant information

## Conversational Interface
- What it does: Allows users to interact with nutrition expertise through natural language conversations
- Why it's important: Makes complex nutrition information accessible without requiring specialized knowledge of nutrition terminology
- How it works: Uses LangChain with LangGraph for memory management to maintain conversation context, enabling follow-up questions and personalized recommendations

## RAG-Enhanced Responses
- What it does: Generates responses by combining LLM capabilities with retrieved nutrition knowledge
- Why it's important: Ensures responses are factually accurate and grounded in authoritative sources rather than general AI knowledge
- How it works: Retrieves relevant nutrition information based on the user's query and uses it to generate tailored responses

## Recommendation Export
- What it does: Allows users to save and export nutritional recommendations and recipes
- Why it's important: Enables users to implement advice in their daily lives by providing persistent access to recommendations
- How it works: Saves conversation highlights and specific recommendations to user profiles for later reference and export

## User Authentication
- What it does: Provides secure, personalized access to the nutrition advisor
- Why it's important: Ensures privacy of health information and enables personalized recommendations based on user history
- How it works: Implements standard authentication mechanisms and maintains user-specific conversation history

# User Experience  
## User Personas
1. Health-Conscious Individual: Someone looking to optimize their nutrition through natural means rather than supplements
2. Person with Suspected Deficiencies: Individual experiencing symptoms that might indicate nutritional deficiencies
3. Traditional Diet Enthusiast: Person interested in implementing traditional food preparation and nutrition principles
4. Alternative Health Practitioner: Professional seeking evidence-based traditional nutrition information to complement their practice

## Key User Flows
1. New User Registration and Onboarding
   - User creates an account
   - User receives brief introduction to the system's capabilities and limitations
   - User is presented with disclaimer about non-medical nature of advice
   - User begins first conversation

2. Nutrition Query and Response
   - User asks question about specific nutrient, symptom, or food
   - System retrieves relevant information from knowledge base
   - System generates comprehensive response with source attribution
   - User can ask follow-up questions that maintain context

3. Saving and Exporting Recommendations
   - User receives valuable nutrition advice
   - User requests to save specific recommendation
   - System confirms save to user profile
   - User exports recommendation as text or PDF

4. Session History Review
   - User accesses previous conversations
   - User reviews past recommendations
   - User continues previous conversation with context maintained

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean, straightforward interface focusing on the conversation
- Clear distinction between chatbot responses and source citations
- Intuitive session management for reviewing past conversations
- Prominent disclaimer about non-medical nature of advice
- Simple export functionality for recommendations and recipes

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
1. **Risk**: Retrieval quality might be insufficient for accurate nutrition advice
   - **Mitigation**: Implement hybrid retrieval strategies, fine-tune embeddings specifically for the nutrition domain, add post-retrieval re-ranking

2. **Risk**: Context management with LangGraph might be challenging
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simpler memory implementation, gradually add complexity, create robust testing framework for memory management

3. **Risk**: Balancing between retrieval accuracy and response speed
   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching strategies, optimize database queries, benchmark different retrieval approaches

4. **Risk**: Integrating multiple LLM providers might increase complexity
   - **Mitigation**: Create abstraction layer for LLM interactions, implement provider-specific optimizations, have fallback mechanisms

## Accuracy and Trust Risks
1. **Risk**: Providing incorrect or potentially harmful nutrition advice
   - **Mitigation**: Implement strict grounding in source material, add clear disclaimers, create filter for potentially harmful advice, implement monitoring for misuse

2. **Risk**: Hallucination of non-existent source information
   - **Mitigation**: Strict citation mechanism, fact verification against retrieved documents, confidence scoring for responses

3. **Risk**: Users treating nutrition advice as medical advice
   - **Mitigation**: Clear disclaimers, careful response phrasing, explicit differentiation between general knowledge and personalized advice

## Resource Constraints
1. **Risk**: Vector database scaling challenges
   - **Mitigation**: Implement efficient chunking, use filtering to reduce search space, optimize embedding storage

2. **Risk**: LLM API costs could become prohibitive
   - **Mitigation**: Implement caching for common queries, optimize prompt length, use lower-cost models for retrieval enhancement

3. **Risk**: Development complexity might exceed available resources
   - **Mitigation**: Phase development carefully, focus on core functionality first, use off-the-shelf components where possible
