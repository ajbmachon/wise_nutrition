      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Core RAG Chain Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of NutritionRAGChain into subtasks covering class structure, document formatting, prompt templates, chain components (query analysis, retrieval, generation, citation), and error handling/validation.",
      "reasoning": "This is a foundational task requiring expertise in RAG architecture with domain-specific adaptations for nutrition. It involves multiple components that need to work together seamlessly, specialized prompt engineering, and proper error handling. The complexity is high as it forms the core of the system."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Enhanced Nutrition Retriever",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the NutritionRetriever implementation into subtasks for domain-specific filtering, metadata-aware retrieval across collections, relevance scoring mechanisms, and evaluation/testing tools.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires specialized knowledge of retrieval systems with domain-specific optimizations. It involves working with multiple collections, implementing custom relevance scoring, and creating evaluation tools. The complexity comes from needing to understand both retrieval algorithms and nutrition domain knowledge."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate LangServe for API Endpoints",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down LangServe integration into subtasks covering chain refactoring for LangServe compatibility, endpoint configuration (invoke, stream, batch), streaming implementation, and response formatting.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves adapting existing code to work with LangServe and setting up multiple endpoint types. The complexity comes from implementing different response modes (streaming, batch) and ensuring proper formatting. Knowledge of LangServe architecture is required."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Conversation Memory with LangGraph",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the conversation memory implementation into subtasks for LangGraph state management setup, thread-based history storage, context window management/pruning, and conversation summary generation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing stateful conversation management with LangGraph, which has moderate complexity. It involves managing conversation context, implementing pruning strategies, and generating summaries. Understanding of LangGraph's state management is essential."
    },

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Refactor FastAPI Structure",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the FastAPI refactoring into subtasks for implementing router-based organization, dependency injection pattern, and standardized response/error handling.",
      "reasoning": "This is a moderately complex task involving architectural changes to the API structure. It requires understanding of modern FastAPI patterns but is primarily a refactoring task rather than building new functionality. The complexity comes from ensuring backward compatibility while improving the structure."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the authentication system implementation into subtasks for user registration/validation, login/session management, JWT implementation with refresh tokens, and password reset functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing security-critical features requiring careful attention to detail. It includes multiple components like registration, login, session management, and password reset. The complexity comes from security requirements and need for robust error handling."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Conversation Session Management",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down conversation session management into subtasks for database schema/storage implementation, session CRUD operations API, and context window management for long conversations.",
      "reasoning": "This task builds on the conversation memory work but focuses on persistence and retrieval. It requires database integration and API development. The complexity is moderate, involving database design and efficient retrieval mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Saved Recommendations System",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the recommendations system into subtasks for database storage implementation, tagging/categorization functionality, and export/sharing capabilities.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a system for managing saved recommendations with categorization and export features. It's relatively straightforward database and API work, with moderate complexity coming from the organization and export functionality."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Enhance Retrieval and Response Quality",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the retrieval enhancement into subtasks for query reformulation, post-retrieval re-ranking, fact-checking implementation, citation generation, and hybrid retrieval strategy implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This is a highly complex task requiring advanced knowledge of RAG systems. It involves implementing sophisticated techniques like query reformulation, re-ranking, and fact-checking. The complexity comes from the technical depth of these algorithms and the need for careful evaluation."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the UI development into subtasks for chat interface implementation, conversation history/management view, and recommendation export functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward UI development task described as 'simple'. It involves building basic interfaces for chat, history viewing, and exporting. The complexity is lower because it's focused on demonstrating functionality rather than creating a sophisticated UI."
